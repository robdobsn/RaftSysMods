# ToDo

[] check why BLE doesn't disconnect immediately when terminated from webble
[] try changing the LL_PACKET_TIME param
[] try other MAX_BLE_PACKET_LEN_DEFAULT values
[] use GAP TX indication to manage buffers
[] implement an incremental encode - or encode buffer as much as possible - to maximise MTU
[] BLE_MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_OUTBOUND_MSGS_MS ??
